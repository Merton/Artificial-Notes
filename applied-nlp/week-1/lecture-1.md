## What is natural language processing?

- **Natural languages** 

natural languages are languages invented by humans, to communicate with humans


- **Processing**

a series of actions, usually performed by a computer to aid in collecting, storing and organising information


- **Natural language processing** 

the automatic manupulation of human languages by computers

- includes speech and text, analysis and generation


### Some applications
- information retrieval
  - retrieve and rank documents on the web that are relevant to a query
- Question/answering
  - Provide answers to questions
- Machine trnaslation
  - translate documents from one natural language to another
- Text simplification
  - Simplify a document (for achild or non-native speaker) ELI5?
- Text summarisation
  - eg, summarise todays news events in a 500 word article
- Opinion monitoring 
  - Eg, find companies with good or bad reviews

## Why NLP is difficult
 - **Variation**, many different ways of expressing the same thing
   - Different languages
   - Different styles / genres
   - Messiness, ungrammiatical, fragmentary, non-standard
- **Ambiguity**, same bit of language can have many different interpretations
   - So much depends on *linguistic context*
- **Creativity and evolution**, language changes
   - New terms, new meanings, within 6 months the language might change naturally that is hard to account for
- **Sparsity**, so many different words, so many different combinations, so many possible contexts
- **Grounding and world knowledge**, language does not exist in isolation
   - Humans do not learn language by purely observing endless stream of languages, we rely on what we see, hear and experience to help process information
   - Ultimately an AI-complete problem
