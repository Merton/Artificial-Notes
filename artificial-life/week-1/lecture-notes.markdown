# Lecture 1

Biology is analytical and reductionist, where as Artificial life (ALife) relies on bottom up synthesis. Biology focuses on understanding the low level, broken down concepts of life, in order to understand the biological system as whole. ALife however, is about putting things together and looking at how systems emerge from this. 

## What is life?
Life is often described by using a cluster of concept such as:
- Self organisation
- Ermergence
- Autonomy
- Growth
- Development

There are two routes of artifical intelligence, theres tradititional, "Old fashioned" AI, which often involves classification, predicition and analyis. The other being Nouvelle AI, this is more interested in dynamic and interactive AI, or we could say, AI that can *survive its environment*.

We are interested in intelligent behaviour *not* intelligent understanding!

Artificial life is about:
- Being **holistic** versus reductionist
- **Systems** level versus system specific
- **feedback** versus input/output
