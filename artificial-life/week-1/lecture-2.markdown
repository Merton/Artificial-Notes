## Essentialism
Life has been historically seen as transcending the material world. Both the body and soul were categorically different to the stuff around us. Although Aristotle regarded animals as complex machines, bodies without souls. 

The beginning of Automata: Heron's Fountain

We have always tried to use mechanisms to account for living systems.

Artificial life was coined by Thomas Hobbes
The development of clocks in the 14th century allowed for more sophisticated mechanistic devices. Humanoid automata are devised.

"For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the beginining whereof is in the pricnipal part within; why may we not say that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheel as doth a watch) have an artifiical life

Instead of saying the life is given by god, and that bodies with a soul are the only life, we can understand humans as being matter and motion obeying the same physicial laws as other matter and motion.
Essentialism gets in the way of the objective and scientific study of humanity. 

Programmable control was developed and generalised by several leading mathematicians ALonzo Church, Kurt Godel Stephen Cole Kleene and ALan Turing

They noted that the rules of logicial progression (the programme) as distinct from the progression itself
The logicial form of a machine was seen as different and separate from the specification, and so the algorithm and general purpose computer was born.

The war, cybernetics and the birth of the computer. Code breaking and anti-aircraft guns drove the innovation around computing, creating the first electronic circuit and interdisplinary teamwork. Cybernetics and control came about from the need to process the realworld smoothly with feedback taken into account.


## The language of life

**Dynamical systems** 
**Computational Systems**

Imagine a machine floats in a pond of machine part. A universal constructor given a description of machine will construct a ma hine from those pars. Given a description of itself it will construct itself.
A blueprint for creating itself.

Von neuman's CA replicator showed that perhaps a universal constructor was not the right way. It was complicated and tricky. We as humans are not general constructor, are "blueprint tape" is our dna. We cannot accept any DNA and reproduce the desired being. We are strict and refined to produce versions of ourselves.

The langton loop was thought as the simplest reproducing machines, then Jogn Byl made a simpler version.
